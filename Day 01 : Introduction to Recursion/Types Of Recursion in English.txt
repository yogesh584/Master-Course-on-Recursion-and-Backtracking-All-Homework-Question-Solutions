Types of Recursion :
    Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one another mutually.
        1. Direct Recursion
        2. Indirect Recursion

    1. Direct Recursion :
        function calls itself from within itself.
        These can be further categorized into four types : 
        1. Tail Recursion.
        2. Head Recursion.
        3. Tree Recursion.
        4. Nested Recursion.

        1. Tail Recursion : 
            Babbar Bhaiya Told us one thing that Recursion have three parts : 
                1. Base Case.
                2. Recursive Relation.
                3. Processing Part / Calculation Part.
            If Recursive Relation Comes After Processing Part Then Recursion Called. Tail Recursion.
        
        2. Head Recursion :
            If Recursive Relation Comes Before Processing Part Then Recursion Called. Head Recursion.
        
        3. Tree Recursion :
            To understand Tree Recursion let’s first understand Linear Recursion.

            Linear Recursion :
                If a recursive function calling itself for one time then it’s known as Linear Recursion.
            if a recursive function calling itself for more than one time then it’s known as Tree Recursion.
        
        4. Nested Recursion :
             In this recursion, a recursive function will pass the parameter as a recursive call. That means “recursion inside recursion”. Called Nested Recursion.
    
    2. Indirect Recursion :
        In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circular manner.
